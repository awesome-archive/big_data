## Keras Tutorial

```
To train and test this model, there are four steps in Keras

1. Create the model by calling the function above
2. Compile the model by calling `model.compile(optimizer = "...", loss = "...", metrics = ["accuracy"])`
3. Train the model on train data by calling `model.fit(x = ..., y = ..., epochs = ..., batch_size = ...)`
4. Test the model on test data by calling `model.evaluate(x = ..., y = ...)`
```
